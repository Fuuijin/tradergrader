## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **EXPERIMENTAL** - This project is in active development and should be used with caution. While functional, it's not recommended for production trading decisions.

### Known Limitations
- No caching implementation (all API calls are real-time)
- Limited to EVE Online ESI API rate limits
- No authentication for private market data
- Experimental status with ongoing development

### Future Plans
